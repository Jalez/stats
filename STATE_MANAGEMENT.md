# State Management Guide

This guide provides detailed information on how Zustand is used to manage the global state in this project.

## Store Setup
The `store.ts` file is the central hub for state management, defining all necessary states and actions.

## Usage
To access or update the state, import the relevant hooks from the `store.ts` file:

```typescript
import useStore from './store';

const user = useStore(state => state.user);
const setUser = useStore(state => state.setUser);
```

...

For more advanced usage and best practices, refer to the Zustand documentation or the additional resources linked here.
