## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jalez/stats.git
   cd stats
   ```

2. **Ensure Node.js (vX.X.X) is installed**:
   You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

### State Management

The application uses Zustand to manage global state. The `store.ts` file defines the application's state and provides methods to update it. This state includes user information, exercise data, submission details, and more.

For detailed usage, see the [State Management Guide](STATE_MANAGEMENT.md).

### Utility Functions

- **Date Sanitization:** Standardizes date formats across the application.
- **API Data Fetching:** Handles requests to external APIs, retrieving necessary data.
- **Uniform Distribution:** Generates uniform distributions for statistical analysis and visualizations.

For more details, refer to the [Utility Functions Guide](UTILITY_FUNCTIONS.md).

### Styled Components

This project uses `styled-components` to create reusable, responsive UI elements. For more information on how to use and extend these components, see the [Styled Components Guide](STYLED_COMPONENTS.md).

### Student Board Components

These components manage and display student-related data, such as scores and progress. For a comprehensive guide on each component, refer to the [Student Board Components Guide](STUDENT_BOARD_COMPONENTS.md).

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, chosen for its component-based architecture and ecosystem.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **Zustand:** A lightweight and scalable state management library, ensuring efficient state updates.
- **styled-components:** A CSS-in-JS library used for creating reusable and responsive UI components.
- **Vite:** A fast development server and build tool, improving developer productivity.
